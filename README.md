## ðŸš€ Future Improvement Ideas

- Functionality to allow users to login using their social media accounts. We attempted to implement this in the beginning, but we realized once we researched it that the process was much more complex than we thought it would be. (For example, Facebook requires you to make a developer account and utilize JavaScript SDK to make the API calls.)
- Make a login authentication page. Right now, it's possible for people inspecting the element to see the user name and password by console logging the localStorage. A possible way to do this would be to utilize a side server such as PHP.
